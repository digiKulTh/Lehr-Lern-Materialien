# The Ancient Temple Adventure

Once upon a time, you found yourself standing at the entrance of an ancient temple deep in the jungle...

[[Continue]]
[[Turn back and go home]]

## Continue
You gather your courage and step into the dimly lit temple entrance. The stone walls are covered in mysterious symbols, and you notice two passages ahead.

[[Take the left passage]]
[[Take the right passage]]

## Turn back and go home
You decide this adventure is too dangerous and head back home. Perhaps another day...

The End.

[[Start over]]

## Take the left passage
The left passage leads you to a room with a golden idol on a pedestal. You see:
1. A suspicious pressure plate in front of it
2. Some loose rocks near the wall

[[Carefully walk around the pressure plate]]
[[Try to throw rocks at the idol]]

## Take the right passage
The right passage opens into a chamber with an ancient puzzle door. There are three levers:
- Red
- Blue
- Green

[[Pull the red lever]]
[[Pull the blue lever]]
[[Pull the green lever]]

## Carefully walk around the pressure plate
Using your archaeological knowledge, you carefully maneuver around the trap and retrieve the idol safely. Congratulations! You've succeeded in your quest!

The End.

[[Start over]]

## Try to throw rocks at the idol
As the rocks hit the idol, the entire room begins to shake! The ceiling starts collapsing! You run out just in time, but empty-handed.

The End.

[[Start over]]

## Pull the red lever
The ground beneath you opens up! You fall into a pit of... soft cushions? It seems this was an escape route. You slide through a tunnel and end up outside with an ancient treasure map!

The End.

[[Start over]]

## Pull the blue lever
A burst of ancient dust fills the room. When it clears, nothing seems to have changed... except your hair is now bright blue!

The End.

[[Start over]]

## Pull the green lever
The door slowly creaks open, revealing a magnificent library of ancient scrolls. You've discovered knowledge far more valuable than gold!

The End.
